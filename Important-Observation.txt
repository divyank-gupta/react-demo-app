Ques. Build a docker image of a react application. Take demo react app from github.
Ans.

1. git clone https://github.com/teambit/react-demo-app.git
	a) In the package.json, changed the react script version to 3.4.0 otherwise while creating docker container, it will only run interactively and when we we build pod out of it, it will go in crash loop back, as we are running container in pod without interactive (-it). So it will crash and the deployment will create it again.

2. Try to run the app locally:
	a) Open cmd -> npm install
	b) npm start

3. Try to run on docker:
	a) Create a .dockerignore file which will ignore the node moules installed in the folder in docker build
	b) Create a docker file
	c) Run container

4. Run on kubernetes
	a) Add a deployment and a service.
